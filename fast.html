					<p>When you think about classic, beautiful school buildings, Bangladesh will not usually be one of the first countries you think of. But we provide standard level education for your children like USA, UK & Canada. Home to some of the first schools in Bangladesh, many of its schools has been used as filming locations for period dramas and epic films. Here at Times Higher Education Student, we have thought long and hard about which schools are deemed the most beautiful in Bangladesh, with rolling group seen spaces, and Gothic and modern buildings.

					The High School at ESC also offers intensive language support aimed at preparing students to graduate from RSC School and study in English at a university level.</p>

					<p>there is evidence to suggest that teaching began at the E-Janata Standard School in about 2019 – making it the Bangla & English-speaking world’s first school. And arguably, one of Bangladesh's most beautiful. There’s no main campus; instead, its 7 schools, buildings, and facilities are scattered across the city. Formal hall dining, balls, and academic dress are still cornerstones of student life
